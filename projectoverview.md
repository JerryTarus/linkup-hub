üìà Link Up Hub: Project Overview & Roadmap
Document Version: 1.0
Date: August 15, 2025

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Link Up Hub application, detailing its core purpose, current development status, a breakdown of critical issues encountered and their resolutions, and a clear roadmap to completion.

1. üéØ Project Vision & Goals
   Link Up Hub is a full-stack, community-driven platform designed to seamlessly connect people through events. Our primary goal is to create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly application where:

Members can discover, RSVP to, and pay for events.

Community Organizers (Admins) have powerful tools to create events, manage users, view analytics, and engage with their community in real-time.

The Platform itself is performant, SEO-friendly, and provides a modern user experience from end to end.

2. ‚úÖ Current Status: What We've Built
   We have successfully built the foundational architecture and core data management features of the application.

Backend (Node.js/Express)
Robust API Server: A fully configured Express server with security middleware (helmet, cors), logging (morgan), and environment variable management.

Secure Authentication: Complete API endpoints for user signup, login, and logout using JWTs stored in secure HttpOnly cookies.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Middleware is in place to protect routes and restrict access based on user roles (e.g., only Admins can create events).

M-PESA Payment Initiation: The API endpoint (/api/v1/payments/initiate) and backend service to trigger a Safaricom Daraja STK Push are complete. The callback logic is also implemented.

Full Event CRUD API: All necessary endpoints for Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting events (/api/v1/events) are fully implemented and protected.

Frontend (Next.js/React)
Modern Project Structure: A well-organized Next.js App Router project with a clear separation of pages, components, and utility functions.

Complete Authentication UI: Fully functional and validated Login and Signup pages that securely communicate with the backend.

Public-Facing Event Pages:

An engaging Landing Page that fetches and displays recent events.

An All Events Page (/events) that lists every available event.

A dynamic Event Detail Page (/events/[id]) that fetches and displays data for a single event using optimized server-side rendering.

Admin "Create Event" Form: A protected, client-side page with a comprehensive form and Zod validation for admins to create new events.

Basic User Dashboard: A secure, server-rendered dashboard page that greets the logged-in user and displays their created events. It also conditionally shows an admin-only "Create Event" button.

3. üêû Critical Issues & Resolutions
   During development, we encountered and resolved several critical issues. Understanding these fixes is key to maintaining the application's stability.

Issue 1: Supabase .from() Error & async/await
Problem: On server-side pages like the event detail page, we were getting a TypeScript error: Property 'from' does not exist on type 'Promise<SupabaseClient>'.

Root Cause: The helper function createSupabaseServerClient() was being treated as if it were asynchronous (returning a Promise). The code was attempting to call .from() on the Promise itself, not on the resolved Supabase client object. The error message Did you forget to use 'await'? was a key clue.

Resolution: The standard implementation of createSupabaseServerClient is synchronous. The error indicated a potential misconfiguration in the helper file itself. We corrected the usage pattern in our page components to ensure we are calling .from() on the actual client instance returned by the function, not a promise of it. This ensures direct, efficient database queries from our Server Components.

Issue 2: isAxiosError Module Error
Problem: In our catch blocks for handling API errors, TypeScript threw an error: Property 'isAxiosError' does not exist on type 'AxiosStatic'.

Root Cause: Modern versions of the Axios library and TypeScript require a more explicit way to handle errors. The error object in a catch block is of type unknown, and the isAxiosError function is a type guard that needs to be imported directly.

Resolution: We updated the Axios import statement from import axios from 'axios' to import axios, { isAxiosError } from 'axios'. We then used this imported function as a type guard (if (isAxiosError(error)) { ... }) which correctly narrows the type of the error object, resolving the TypeScript error and making our error handling type-safe.

Issue 3: Deprecated Notification UI (useToast)
Problem: When trying to add the toast component with npx shadcn-ui@latest add toast, the command failed, stating that the component is deprecated in favor of Sonner.

Root Cause: The Shadcn/UI library has officially replaced its original toast component with a new, more modern implementation built on the Sonner library. The old useToast hook no longer exists.

Resolution:

We followed the new recommendation and installed the Sonner component using npx shadcn-ui@latest add sonner.

We added the <Toaster /> component to the root layout.tsx file.

We refactored all pages (like Login and Signup) to use the new, simpler API: we now import { toast } from 'sonner' and call functions like toast.success(...) and toast.error(...) directly, without needing a hook.

4. üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap to Completion & Production
   The foundation is strong. The following roadmap outlines the features required to achieve full functionality and prepare for a production launch.

Phase 1: Core User Interaction (Immediate Priority)
Implement Event RSVP & Payments:

Task: Create a client-side component to handle the "RSVP/Buy Ticket" button logic.

Task: Build the backend API endpoint (POST /api/v1/events/:id/rsvp) for free events.

Task: Implement the frontend modal for collecting phone numbers for M-PESA payments.

Task: Connect the payment modal to the existing /api/v1/payments/initiate endpoint and handle UI feedback.

Implement User Profile Management:

Task: Create the backend API (PUT /api/v1/profiles/me) for users to update their own profiles.

Task: Build the /dashboard/profile page with a form for users to edit their information (username, bio, etc.).

Phase 2: Real-Time Engagement
Build Chat & Announcements UI:

Task: Integrate the existing ChatRoom component into a dedicated, user-friendly chat interface within the dashboard.

Task: Design and implement a UI element (e.g., a notification dropdown or banner) that subscribes to the announcements table in real-time.

Phase 3: Advanced Admin Capabilities
Build Full Admin Dashboard:

Task: Create an admin-only section (/dashboard/admin) with protected routes.

Task: User Management: Build a table to list all users with functionality to shadow-ban or change roles.

Task: Financial Analytics: Create a dashboard page that displays payment data from the payments table, including total revenue, payments per event, etc. Use charts (recharts) for data visualization.

Task: Event Analytics: Display key metrics like RSVP counts and ticket sales for each event.

Task: Announcements Interface: Build a form for admins to write and publish new announcements.

Phase 4: Production Readiness
Comprehensive Testing:

Task: Write unit tests (Jest) for critical backend services (e.g., payment validation).

Task: Write end-to-end tests (Playwright/Cypress) for key user flows (Signup -> Login -> Create Event -> RSVP).

Deployment & CI/CD:

Task: Prepare production build configurations for both frontend and backend.

Task: Set up automated deployment pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to deploy the frontend to Vercel and the backend to Render/Fly.io.

Final Review:

Task: Conduct a final security audit, performance review (Lighthouse), and cross-browser compatibility check.
